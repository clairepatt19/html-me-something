<p class="herb">The herb Astragalus.</p>
<p class="herb">This special plant is native to China where it has been used for thousands of years; it is becoming more
    and more popular in Western herbalism and is now cultivated in the U.S.</p>
<p class="herb">In Traditional Chinese Medicine astragalus is considered to be a restorative tonic, as it improves energy and stamina when used over time. Modern herbalists would call 
    it an adaptogenic herb since it helps the body to overcome stress, disease and weakness and increases ones resiliency.
    A sweet tasting, yellow-rooted plant, astragalus is an important herb for the home apothecary, especially in the winter months. Every fall I pull out my stash of sliced roots 
    and start incorporating them into my soups and broths. In Traditional Chinese Medicine astragalus is considered to be a restorative tonic, as it improves energy and stamina when used over time. Modern herbalists would call 
    it an adaptogenic herb since it helps the body to overcome stress, disease and weakness and increases ones resiliency.

<p class="herb">An important immune system tonic, astragalus is wonderful when used preventatively against winter-time illnesses such as colds, flu, bronchitis and pneumonia. 
Not only does this root increase resistance to disease it also helps to tone and strengthen the lungs, which are the gathering place for infections and congestion. 
Astragalus root is also known to increase the number of stem cells in bone marrow and lymph tissue and encourages their development into active immune cells.</p>

<p class="herb">Whereas some herbs can open the body up to release toxins and pathogens through perspiration (such as a diaphoretic herb like elderflower), 
astragalus is on the opposite end of the spectrum: it helps to close off the body to outside influences and germs. Because of this closing or 
sealing action some people have even noticed that it reduces the amount that they perspire. This property is very useful when we are trying to 
avoid catching other peoples germs, especially during cold and flu season. We can think of astragalus as a shield against illness. 
Traditional Chinese medicine states that it increases the protective chi around the body that keeps out cold, infection and external influences.</p>

<p class="herb">You want to be sure to use this amazing action at the appropriate time, though. 
Because of the sealing property it has on the physical body traditional wisdom advises to avoid
astragalus if you are sick or have an acute infection. That’s because it closes the body to external 
influences and prevents fewer things from coming in OR going out. Astragalus really is an herb best 
used to strengthen the immune system and prevent sickness… it is not for times of acute illness.</p>
</div>

<p>>HOW TO USE ASTRAGALUS:

To make a decoction of the root use 1 Tbsp. of the dried root per 2 cups of water and simmer for at least 20 minutes in a small, 
covered saucepan.
    
Astragalus slowly builds up the immune system and needs to be taken over longer periods of time (weeks to months) 
to be most effective. For prevention and immune-strengthening effects take daily. One of the best ways to get the 
supportive benefits of this herb is to eat it in soups and broths.

<h3>Information regarding interactions</h3>
<p>With the increase in those taking both herbs and drugs, the potential for herb-drug interactions exist, 
but we need to put the issue into perspective. Food/drug interactions are far more common, as we consume far 
greater quantities of food than herbal medicines. Grapefruit juice inhibits liver detoxification activity and
can increase serum levels of many drugs including calcium antagonists and anthistamines. Milk interferes with 
absorption of Tetracycline by 50-90%. Green leafy vegetables (spinach, cabbage, beet greens, kale), broccoli, peas
and cucumbers, can alter coagulation and interact with anticoagulant medications. Drug/drug interactions are even more 
common. Even the seemingly benign antacids with polyvalent minerals (Ca, Fe, Mg, Zn, Al) can interfere with cycline and 
mycin antibiotics. Tobacco smoke is of the most potent substances affecting liver detoxification activity—it decreases blood 
levels of many medications and vitamin C. In fact, the potential for drug/drug interaction for those patients taking multiple drugs 
(6 or more) is close to 100%.</p>
<p>Herb/drug interactions occur...but note the types of herb/drug interactions, and that many are actually positive and could result in the ability to decrease drug dosage:

    Decreased bioavailability of medicine - decreased absorption (Psyllium Seed, Flax Seed, Slippery Elm), enhanced metabolism (Brassicas), or enhanced elimination (Senna, Coffee, Cascara Sagrada).
    Increased bioavailability of medicine - increased absorption (Ginger, Cayenne, Prickly Ash, Black Pepper), decreased metabolism (Grapefruit juice), or decreased elimination (Licorice).
    Potentiation of drug’s effects - via a different but complementary action (Siberian Ginseng & antibiotics).
    Potentiation of drug’s effects via similar activity (Lasix & Dandelion Leaf, Digoxin & Lily of the Valley).
    Protection from adverse drug effects (Milk Thistle & hepatotoxic / nephrotoxic herbs, Licorice & corticosteroids).
    6. Antagonistic or incompatible activities (laxatives & astringents, CNS stimulants & sedatives).</p>
