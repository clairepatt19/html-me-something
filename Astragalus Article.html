    <p>Scientists, particularly in Asia, have extensively studied Astragalus since it is one of the important tonic herbs of traditional Chinese medicine. 
    Pharmacological and clinical studies confirm its immunostimulant, antibacterial, antiviral, anti-inflammatory, adaptogenic, liver-protecting, and diuretic effects. 
    It also improves stamina. Like ginseng, Astragalus is considered an adaptogen. Adaptogens are defined as an innocuous substance that causes minimal disorders of an 
    organism's function. It must have a “nonspecific action” that normalizes body functions, no matter what the condition or disease. Adaptogens are essentially general tonics. 
    No single compound is responsible for its wide-ranging effects, though polysaccharides are involved in immunostimulant activity. Astragalus is one of a number of herbs used in 
    fu-zheng therapy. Fu-zheng refers to treating disease by enhancing or promoting the host defense mechanism, or normalizing the central energy. In the West, we would classify it as 
    an immunostimulant. This activity is believed to come from polysaccharides, especially astragalan I, II, and III. Other components that may contribute to beneficial effects include 
    saponins and triterpenes.

    Chinese research groups in the mid-1970s stimulated scientific interest in Astragalus. They were attempting to verify and pharmacological and clinical basis for the ancient practice of 
    fu-zheng therapy. However, this time they were studying its value in modern medicine. In modern China, three systems of medicine are recognized: 1) modern western medicine;
     2) the ancient system of traditional Chinese medicine; 3) a combination of western and traditional Chinese medicine. It is in the context of combined Chinese and western medicine that researchers 
    sought to find answers. Realizing that various agents used in chemotherapy in cancer patients tended to suppress the immune system, making patients more susceptible to secondary disease conditions, 
    the researchers looked at the potential of Astragalus to increase immune function in chemotherapy patients. The fu-zheng therapy research group began its work in 1975. In the 1970s and early 1980s, 
    Chinese scientists published several studies on the use of Astragalus as immune system stimulants for chemotherapy and radiation-treated cancer patients. Astragalus was found to act as non-specific immune 
    system stimulant, and helped to protect adrenal cortical function during radiation or chemotherapy treatment. The Astragalus treatment enhanced the activity of bone marrow, depressed by the chemotherapy and 
    radiation, to produce more white blood cells, the guardians of the immune system, while increasing their ability to “ingest” invading particles (such as bacteria or viruses). The Astragalus treatment also 
    modified gastrointestinal toxicity of patients receiving conventional cancer therapies. The end result was a significant increase in survival rates for the patients receiving fu-zheng therapy as an adjunct to 
    Western medical cancer treatments.

    Researchers at several institutions in Houston, Texas performed a number of laboratory and clinical studies on Astragalus as well as Chinese privet (Ligustrum lucidum). In testing the restorative effect of water 
    extracts of the polysaccharide fraction of Astragalus membranaceus on 19 cancer patients and 15 healthy persons they found that the extracts restored T-cell function in 9 of 10 patients. Using an assay for T-cell 
    restoration, they confirmed that the extracts appeared to restore levels in the cancer patients to those observed in the normal healthy donors. The small clinical study coupled with laboratory tests showed that the 
    herb extract had a strong immune stimulant effect, providing further evidence of it efficacy. Further laboratory studies revealed other mechanisms of action, as well as a polysaccharide fraction, believed to be primarily 
    responsible for the immunostimulant effects. The research was discontinued due to lack of funding. While chemotherapy and radiation may cause a reduction in the activity of the immune system, certain types of tumors may also 
    produce a suppression of the immune system. In addition to immunostimulatory effects on cancer patients, several laboratory studies with mice have shown anticancer activity with Astragalus, related to its ability to potential 
    natural killer cells. A number of studies have shown strong antiviral activity for patients suffering from Coxsackie B viral myocarditis. Extracts of Astragalus have been tested for antiviral activity against the HIV virus, but
    with negative results. Experimentally, it has also been shown to augment interferon response to viruses.
    <p>Astragalus, an important herb in Chinese traditions for over two millennia, is becoming increasingly important in the American market. Traditional use has been confirmed by numerous pharmacological studies and some clinical studies. 
    Scientists have demonstrated immunostimulant activity, antiviral effects and an immuno-restorative function in various cancers. Its acceptance in the American market will be further solidified by well-designed, controlled clinical trials. 
    These studies have yet to be conducted.
